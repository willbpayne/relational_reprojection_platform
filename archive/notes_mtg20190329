ACTION PTS:
WP: - clean out X+Y vars
EM: - make alt dataset
	- fix contours
	- do slides
	- email whatsherface re phys data
	- setup google slides

stays in code, stays in presentation

Later?
	- if we figured out how to do it as as custom projection, could do this in proj4/gis world, not R

	sort of tools we're making

everything should be easier than it was in the 1960s


In this talk, we're interested in reclaiming some of what was lost of the quantitative revolution of the 1960s by buiding new tools

	01 Title
	02 Problem: draw a mtn range, now do it with GIS
	03 Problem2: bunge graphic: so many depictions of distance/time/blahabl that were straightforward if timeconsuming one-offs are no easier due to our unceasing devotion to GIS and standard scripting tools
	04 The pin map has improved, but not more experimental things
	05 Statement: this project is less a technical talk (but come to NACIS to see that one) than a provocation on what it means to reclaim this space. Digital geographies as a discursive tool rather than only an end.

	06 Case study: relative distace -- distance itself has a long history, but we're mostly interested in de-emphasizing superlative distances when they don't add to the story
	07 Problem: stuck between pin map and network, but sometimes space is "sorta" important
	08 Solution: built a script to suck in data, take a center point, fill the rest of data into the space
	09 Some before/afters
	10 What that means technically: eg, great circle dists, stereographic projections, etc etc
	
	11 What that means for those who use the software: different ways of thinking about data, different kind of access aout of walled garden of GIS expertise
	12 Use cases 
	13 
	14 Implications
