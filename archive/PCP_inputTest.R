### LIBRARIES
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(geosphere)
library(gmt) # geodist is in geosphere under a different name--need to fix

### DATA READING
  # test file: testData/routes_bare_sm.csv
  dataPath <- readline(prompt="Enter file Path: ")
  dataPath <- file.path(dataPath)
  
  df <- read.csv(file = dataPath)


### DATA PROCESSING
  #### AT SOME POINT WE SHOULD VALIDATE.
  #### FOR THE TIME BEING, JUST NAIVE COL RE-NAME
  
  ### THIS WORKS, BUT FOR SIMPLICITY, JUMP TO LINE 46-ish FOR NAIVE SETUP
