It's right past where you walk in. It has lots of room so you can bring a few buds. There's also plenty of booths and tables. On tap are lots of craft and local beers. They have a happy hour special when you can get $1 off certain drafts. As for the food, the pizza is the best. The rest of the menu is mostly fried stuff. Pizza in whatever size here is expensive.

The resturant was still pretty busy- which was surprising. We found free street parking and there's an outdoor patio. After being seated we started with garlic knots. The order came with two large knots. Due to the size the only garlic taste was on the outside. I felt like I was eating plain bread. I don't think I would order this again. At around $15 a pizza this is an expensive dinner. The pizzas are individually sized and the only way to share is if you were to order a salad and an appetizer. I went with the Cheesus Crust- a multi cheese white pizza. The goat cheese was WAY to over powering. I couldn't taste anything else. My boyfriend went with the Spring Chick- pesto base with Chicken. He liked the pizza but didn't find it worth the money. We both took pizza home but I wasn't in a rush to eat it. I will say that the resturant has a build your own option (cost adds up super quick) which I would probably do the next time.

They have us a buzzer and we could go to the little cage next door for a drink while we waited. Each of us ordered our own pizza. Between us we had The Jimmy, The Drive," The Cabbage Patch and The Pork. We all shared so I was able to try all four. I think they were all excellent but my favorite had to the The Jimmy. The meatballs on it were so delicious. But my second favorite what The Cabbage Patch with its Brussel Sprouts. My friends had some IPA that was on tap but I was driving home that night and didn't try any. They did like it though. Our waiter was funny and sweet. He took real good care of us. Got to play ping pong too for a bit but there were a bunch of people waiting so we didn't play too long. I believe they have 4 ping pong tables and it's free to play. That was fun.

As the other Yelpers have mentioned, the restaurant also has a parking lot in the back (which was reassuring when we decided to drive there from Alexandria, VA). I really enjoyed the dessert I had with my friends (after a spirited round of ping pong in the back of the restaurant). The non-dessert food was just okay and was somewhat limited for a vegetarian such as myself (which frankly surprised me because pizza places usually are safe bet for vegetarians). My pizza had garlic. Instead, of having the garlic minced or shredded on the pizza; I had 2 large cloves of garlic placed on my pizza. Our waiter was a little scattered brained.

So much gluten free bread products are thin and crispy and what I miss most about eating gluten is that soft doughy sensation that you get when you take a bite. The crust on the pizza is just like that! I highly recommend it. Their other options are not so gluten friendly in terms of appetizers and certainly not desserts. They do have some gluten free beers.

Let me count the ways.1) The interior is super cool. Berlin-esque industrial chic that feels amazing without looking like they're trying too hard. Bedazzled brick-things hanging from the ceiling in lieu of disco balls; sweet textures on some of the exposed walls; and the most glorious murals in the bathrooms.2) The food is up to snuff. Comet rotates their menu fairly regularly to keep up with what's fresh at the moment. This can mean less exciting things during the winter, when there's less good produce available, but there's always something unique and delicious on the menu. Get the roasted cauliflower appetizer. Yum.3) A solid and frequently rotating beer selection...with pitchers (though they're pricey),1031,0,-77.03196,38.89037

Still, the waitstaff was not very attentive and even though our takeout order was ready it took a long time for someone to give it to us and process our payment, which meant that our pizza was just sitting out, getting cold. We took the pizza home and dug in right away and wow--so underwhelming. We had each made our own pizza instead of picking one of the ones on the menu. I got a gluten-free tomato pie with kalamata olives and spinach and my brother got a regular one with a weird combo of toppings (his choice). This was the worst gluten-free pizza I've had in a while! The crust was spongy and soggy and felt wet. The toppings were sparse (maybe 6 olives on the whole thing?) and bland. I ended up toasting the slice in a skillet just to try to get the crust to firm up a little. Somewhat successful. GF pizzas look small and wimpy most of the time so I appreciated that this was big (even bigger than my brother's non-GF pie)...until I took a bite and realized that the size was maybe the only impressive thing.

We were greeted and seated right away. I loved the industrial warehouse feel. I had a nice cold Allegash White. We ordered 3 pizzas (one pizza could feed a hungry person). We had a smokey, a hottie," and a Stanley. The Stanley was the best by far. We ended up ordering a second Stanley. Then after we stuffed ourselves we went to the back to play some ping pong. It was a casual fun environment. Plus we got to jam out to some Johnny Cash while playing. I would make the drive again!!!""""",1238,0,-77.6513,38.97842
